# XFCloudStorage
Trying to unify access to personal cloud storage like Google Drive, OneDrive, DropBox &amp; iCloud using **Xamarin.Forms**.

This is based on the GitHub project: [XamarinGoogleDriveRest](https://github.com/stevenchang0529/XamarinGoogleDriveRest)

## Currently working on *Google Drive* access:
1. ***On Android:*** It works. No issues.

1. ***On iOS:***
     1. Current Issue: After tapping the **[Allow]** button in the *accounts.google.com* page, after few seconds of wait it just displays *google.com* page and it doesn't return to this app like in Android.

1. ***On UWP:***
     1. Current Issue: It is same as that for iOS, the control is not returned to the app.
